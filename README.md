# Building a CLI Project

## Introduction
You will put everything you learned together and build a command line application that utilizes different NPM packages. These could be packages that were used this past week or ones that you researched and found on your own.

## Ideas
Here are some ideas to get you thinking of what to implement:
- Math based game - guess a random number
- Tic Tac Toe
- Tip Calculator
- ReadMe.Md Generator
- Day Scheduler
- To-Do Tracker

## Getting Started  
You can write all your code in `app.js` and check your code by running:

```bash
node app.js
```

## As a developer I want to. . .
- The application to run in the command line
- Utilize different NPM packages
- Create and utilize functions
- Implement JavaScript data structures (arrays, objects)
- Implement at least one loop (`for`, `while`, etc.)
- The application to start when a function is invoked
- Display the output to the user
